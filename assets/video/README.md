# Video Background Assets

Place video files (e.g., `bg3.mp4`) in this directory to use them as background videos for the game themes.

The video will automatically be constrained to the game playfield area (the inner game border) and will not cover the entire screen.

## Supported formats
- MP4 (`.mp4`)
- WebM (`.webm`)
- Ogg (`.ogg`)

## Note
If a video file fails to load or is not found, the game will automatically fall back to the procedural shader-based background.
